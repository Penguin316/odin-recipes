            <li>1 pound frozen shrimp, thawed and peeled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>

    <h2>How to Make the Yummy Yum Yums</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and dry shrimp.</li>
            <li>Whisk olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, pepper, and 
                parsley together in a bowl and pour into a large 
                resealable plastic bag. Add shrimp, coat with the 
                marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. 
                Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly 
                oil the grate. Lightly coat metal skewers with 
                cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp from the marinade and shake off excess. 
                Discard the remaining marinade. Place about 5 shrimp 
                on each skewer.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until shrimp are bright 
                pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 5 
                minutes; do not overcook.</li>
        </ol>
