    <h1>Steve's Roasted Chicken Soft Tacos</h1>
    <img src="chicken.png" alt="Chicken Tacos">
    <h2>Rotisserie chicken soft tacos made with homemade 
        flour tortillas and pico de gallo.</h2>
        <p>When I find myself taking the easy way out of 
            making dinner by picking up a roast chicken 
            at the market, I try to make up for it by 
            making the leftover chicken taste like 
            something new. This recipe totally works 
            for me. The only thing I add is a big squeeze 
            of lime juice. My husband likes to put sour 
            cream on his, but that's just how he rolls. 
            Oh, and I heat up the tortillas.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 rotisserie chicken, meat removed 
                and chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>12 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups pico de gallo salsa</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps to Perfection!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; 
                cook and stir chicken, chili powder, cayenne pepper, 
                salt, and black pepper together in the hot oil until 
                chicken is heated through, about 10 minutes. Spoon 
                chicken mixture onto each tortilla and top with pico 
                de gallo and Mexican cheese blend.</li>
        </ol>
